## 💻 Installation & Running Locally

Follow these steps to set up the Verdent Vibe project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git  # Replace with your repo URL
cd [your-repo-name]
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

You need to install dependencies separately for the **client** and the **server**.

#### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

#### Server

Open a new terminal tab/window, then:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

> **Note:** If your server directory or package manager commands differ, please adjust accordingly.

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in the root of **client** and **server** folders with the following contents:

#### Client `.env`

Create a file named `.env` inside the `client` folder and add:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com        # Replace with your API base URL
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
```

#### Server `.env`

Create a file named `.env` inside the `server` folder and add:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

> **Important:** Never commit `.env` files to your public repository as they contain sensitive information.

### 4. Run the Development Servers

#### Start Client Server

In the client directory terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or the port shown in the terminal.

#### Start Backend Server

In the server directory terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

Or if you use another start script (like `nodemon`), replace accordingly.

### 5. Open the Application

Once both servers are running, open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the Verdent Vibe app running locally.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips

* Make sure you have **Node.js** (version 16 or later recommended) and **npm** installed.
* If you get any errors related to missing dependencies, try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again.
* Ensure your MongoDB database is running and accessible if using a local or remote database.
* For Firebase, confirm your API keys and domains are correctly set in the `.env` file.

---

### Optional: Build for Production

If you want to build the client for production later, run inside the client folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates optimized static files inside `client/dist` which you can serve via a static server or your backend.
